CURRENTLY ON REFACTORING, 1ST WAVE.

Tasks recently done:
    (NETWORKING)
    -Add 'net' package for network-related stuff.
	Anything that talks to stuff other than the host computer goes there.
    -Add 'NetFetch'class for high-level network operations.
    -Add 'NoResponseException' Exception that represents the possibility
	of 'NetFetch' failing to acquire the data a caller expects .


    (ARCHITECTURE/DOMAIN)
    -Add generic 'CriticalException' Exception for unrecoverable situations.
	This is meant for failing gracefully, allowing an application to 
	at least be aware that the Weather Subsystem can no longer function.
    -Offload network interaction from Providers to a separate class
	(That is the whole point of creating the Network abstraction).


Tasks:
    -Convert WeatherStatus class from static to singleton to allow renaming.

GOAL FOR R2:
    -Add National Weather Provider in same working state as OpenWeather.
EXTRA FOR R2(MAY BE POSTPONED TO R3):
    -Add wind speed to weatherLog and the backends.
