# WeatherSync
Provide weather for any place at any time using whichever metrics are preferred.
This application is meant as practice for object-oriented pogramming and may be presented in an academic setting.

## Project status 
Very early work in progress. _It just doesn't workâ„¢_!
Mostly consists of interfaces and foundation work.
Hopefully enough progress will be made for a terminal application that prints something along the lines of:
`hello $(CURRENT_TEMP) world, it is $(HOW_HOT_IT_FEELS) today in $(CURRENT_LOCATION)!` 

## About the application's internals and the three-party model
As of this early stage, WeatherSync is split into 3 main segments: the __provider__, the __consumer__ and the __log__.
### Provider
this class is responsible for acquiring weather-related data from an external agent and generating a properly formatted __log__ upon request of the __consumer__.
### Log
this class contains whatever information the __consumer__ needs regarding weather (ex: temperature, cloudiness, pressure, humidity, UV index, dew point...)
### Consumer
this class uses whatever information needed from the __log__ it requests from the __provider__ in order to perform whatever duty it is designed to do.
A wide variety of tasks may be carried on by the consumer, with outcomes affected by the information it pulls from the __log__.

Each of these three classes may be further broken down into separate segments if the particular implementation turns out large enough.
such constructs may include things like:
- a cache subsystem for a JSON-API-based provider to optimize its network usage.
- a 4rth party __arbiter__ that checks wether the pieces of weather information required __consumer__ are available from a set of one or more __providers__.
- a dedicated __Parameter__ class encapsulating each parameter in the __log__, with methods to identify wether the field is available, what unit it is in and what is its value, be it numerical, boolean or an enumeration.
